# Dual-CNN-of-Ensemble-learning-with-Attention-Mechanism-for-Classification-Task

This experiment introduces image classification using a wheat leaf dataset, employing an ensemble learning model with dual convolutional neural networks (Resnet and Inception) and an attention mechanism. 

The experimental process includes data preprocessing, model construction, training, testing, and comparison with pretrained models. 

Through detailed methodology, the experiment successfully achieved effective classification of different categories of images. 

The main results include the model's performance on various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, recall rate, F1 score, precision, AUC value, etc.
